# OOPS using C++

Object Oriented Programming(OOPS) using C++. But first we start from basics of programming.

The most important aspect of programming is problem solving.

1. Understand the problem.
2. Analyze the given values.
3. Approach the problem in right manner.
4. Creating a program

Flow chart/Pseudocode are useful as rough work.

### Flowchart:

Diagramatical form of the program.

Some standard components of the flowchart are as such:
![](/assets/image/flowchartcomp)

Let's implement a program using flowchart.\

Sum of two numbers:\

### Pseudocode

Generic way of representing a code.

Let's implement a program using pseudocode.

Sum of two numbers:

1. Read two numbers, a and b.
2. sum = a+b
3. Print sum.
