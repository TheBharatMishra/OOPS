## Encapsulation

Wrapping up data members and functions.

### Full Encapsulated Class:

In which all the data members are private.

```
private:
    int num;
    string label;
```

can only be accessed within the same class.

Advantages of using encapsulation:

- Encapsulation is also called Data Hiding/ Information Hiding
- Security improves as accessibility of the data members becomes unavailable.
- We can make class read only.
- Code Reusability.
- Helps in unit testing
